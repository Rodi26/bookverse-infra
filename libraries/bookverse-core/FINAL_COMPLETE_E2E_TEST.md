# FINAL COMPLETE E2E VALIDATION

This test validates the COMPLETE fixed workflow:

âœ… ALL ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. Evidence library path resolution  
2. Missing EVIDENCE_PRIVATE_KEY environment variables
3. Evidence signing keys generated and deployed
4. Enhanced application creation logic for mixed builds
5. APPLICATION_KEY fix for AppTrust API calls
6. String payload format matching recommendations service

This forces both builds to test the complete AppTrust integration.
