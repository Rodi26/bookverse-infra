# Final Test - Exact Checkout Pattern

Testing workflow with exact same OIDC setup as working checkout service:
✅ In-job JFrog CLI setup (not shared workflow)
✅ Same provider name pattern  
✅ Same AppTrust API call format
✅ No extra headers that checkout doesn't use

This should resolve the HTTP 403 issue.
